# Argon - Combat HUD (Daggerheart)
Daggerheart - Argon integration

A Foundry VTT module that enhances the combat HUD for the Daggerheart system using the ARGON Combat Hud CORE.

Warning: I smashed this together with very little javascript experience and some AI garbage.

## Features

- Improved combat interface for Daggerheart.
- Quick access to character actions and stats.

## Folder Structure

- `lang/` - Localization files for multiple languages.
- `scripts/` - JavaScript files for HUD logic and interactivity.
- `styles/` - CSS files for custom HUD styling.
- `templates/` - Handlebars templates for HUD UI components.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Place the folder in your Foundry VTT `modules` directory.
3. Enable "Argon - Combat HUD (Daggerheart)" in your Foundry VTT game.

## Usage

Once enabled, the enhanced HUD will automatically appear during combat encounters in Daggerheart games.
